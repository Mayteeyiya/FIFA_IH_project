# FIFA_IH_project
My first Ironhack project.

The instructions:

Open the file in `file_for_project/fifa21_training.csv`. The objective is to create the best linear model to predict the column `OVA`.

You can find some documentation about the meaning of each column in the following links:

- [link - 0](https://sofifa.com/)
- [link - 1](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/167318/what-do-fifa-14-position-acronyms-mean)
- [link - 2](https://www.fifauteam.com/fifa-ultimate-team-positions-and-tactics/)

Decide which columns can be predictive and which ones can be directly dropped and take the needed actions.
